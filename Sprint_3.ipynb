For example, items like woollen\n","can be increased in stock if there is a cold wave predicted.\n","\n","* Stores located in areas with higher average income can keep an increased stock of premium products (mostly from categories \"B\" and \"C\") to maintain their supply.\n","\n","* Increase the stock of all items, irrespective of classification, during weekends because that is when most sales happen.\n","\n","## Cost analysis of the above initiatives\n","\n","We propose to treat an item's cost as directly proportional to the inventory time it has to spend in the warehouse before being sold. The cost can be calculated by calculating the waste (difference in stock obtained and stock sold) on a per-time basis.\n","\n","$$\\text{Waste} = \\text{Stock_Obtained}-\\text{Stock_Sold}$$\n","\n","$$\\text{Cost} \\propto \\text{Waste}$$\n","\n","The above-proposed cost can be used to calculate how risky it is to implement the above initiatives. If the cost of an initiative is higher than the reward it provides, it is not a viable decision to make.\n","\n","### Inventory\n","\n","* The first initiative does not increase the cost as the increase of stock of type \"A\" products is being done while reducing the stock of type \"B\" and \"C\" items.\n","\n","* The second initiative does increase the cost as a steady supply of low Coefficnet of Variation items has to be supplied, but as the items are proven to be in steady demand, the reward of implementing the strategy outweighs the increase in the cost.\n","\n","* The third initiative only increases the cost during rush periods like holiday seasons, but as they are known periods of high sales, the read outweighs the cost.\n","\n","### Cost\n","\n","* The first initiative increases the cost during the periods of seasonal product requirement, but most of the sales of such products only happen during that particular period. The reward outweighs the cost.\n","\n","* The second initiative increases the cost for shops located in higher-income areas, but as the customers in this area are assumed to have a higher purchasing power, we can safely assume that the reward in increased sales would outweigh the cost.\n","\n","* The third initiative increases the operational cost during the weekends, but as weekends observe an increase in sales, the reward obtained outweighs the additional cost."],"metadata":{"id":"1deydCINs_Hr"}}]}
